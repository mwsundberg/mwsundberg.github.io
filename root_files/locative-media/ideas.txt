transitions
talking
stories
distortion of noises
swap cities
skipping audio, warping intentions
day and night with time ones on other side of the world
on opposite sides of the globe
what if able to play live sounds trailing yourself, laggy atmospheric audio
blind people	explore cities with sound
open source it, so other people can add it
If in buffalo go to times beack nature reserve

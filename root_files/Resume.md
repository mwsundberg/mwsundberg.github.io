## Education
### **University of Rochester** (Fall 2017-)
Pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science

Minoring in Digital Media Studies and Linguistics

### **Crescent Valley High School** (2013-2017)
Graduated having taken seven honors courses and four AP courses, including Calculus BC.

## Work and Leadership Experience
### **Event and Classroom Management Technical Assistant** (Fall 2017-)
Job consists of assisting professors with technical issues on the fly, managing classroom access, and ensuring that the equipment needed to teach classes is functional and available when it is needed. 

### **FIRST Robotics** Team 955 CV Robotics (2014-2017)
FIRST Robotics consisted of a intensive 6 week season when the team of 30-40 members builds a robot from scratch including electrical wiring, milling and fabrication of parts, and programming and tuning. The team then competes with other robots at several levels of competition in the local area through to the world level.

#### **Business Subteam Captain** (2016 Season)
Consisted of writing grant applications, running fundraisers, designing posters and flyers, and maintaining the team website.

#### **Team Captain** (2017 Season)
Consisted of leading 40 team members through a six week season of building a robot from scratch including programming, fabrication, and electrical wiring. Continued through the month long competition season where the team competed at the District and Regional levels, then continued through to the World Championship.

### **Robotic Grasp Simulation Internship** (Summer 2016)
Internship at Oregon State University (OSU) Robotics & Human Control Systems Lab with Dr. Cindy Grimm, 200+ hours. The internship consisted of self guided work developing a program in Matlab to efficiently model and fingerprint the ways that an object could slip out of a robotic grasp. Unfortunately [the project](https://github.com/OSUrobotics/transformationLimitsMetric) was unfinished by the start of the school year and the end of my internship.

### **Eye Tracking Data Analysis Internship** (Summer 2015)
Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering internship at OSU Robotics & Human Control Systems Lab with Dr. Ravi Balasubramanian.

* 300+ hours at 40hrs/week
* Data analysis with Matlab of eye-tracking coordinate data and survey results to analyse and draw conclusions on what regions of an image of a robotic hand holding an object are used to judge the robustness of the grasp. 
* Resulted in the publication of a [research paper](https://mws.is/2016ICRApaper.pdf) in the [International Conference on Robotics and Automation](https://www.icra2016.org). At the conference the paper was a [finalist for the Best Manipulation Paper Award](https://www.icra2016.org/conference/awards/).

## Web Projects
### **Hackathon Project:** [Map Music](https://mws.is/map-music) (Fall 2019)
[Github page](https://github.com/mwsundberg/map-music)
I made this project in collaboration with Nathan Reed. We wondered about what terrain sounded like, so we made an audio synthesizer that uses elevation data to make music. These sounds are then customizable, and composable, and exportable.

### **Pipeline Testing:** [Link Shortener](https://l.mws.is/) (Summer 2017)
[Gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/mws/L).
A link shortener that makes redirect pages with custom or automatically assigned text from links stored in a JSON file. Built using Node.js. Visit the site for a more thorough description.

### **Team Website:** [CV Robotics Website](http://team955.org) (Fall 2015-Spring 2016)

[Github page](https://github.com/FRC-Team-955/TeamWebsite).
Please note that the site has been maintained by later students and as such content may be out of date or improperly functioning. The design, main features, and structure remain of my work.

### **Class Project:** [Cold War Digital Museum Site](https://mws.is/e-waste) (Spring 2016)
[Github page](https://github.com/mwsundberg/apushMuseum).
Page made with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) pipelines, HTML preprocessor [Pug](https://pugjs.org/), and CSS preprocessor [Less](http://lesscss.org/).

### **Class Project:** [E-Waste Awareness Site](https://mws.is/e-waste) (Spring 2015)
[Github page](https://github.com/mwsundberg/e-waste/tree/gh-pages).
An old website made using Bootstrap, one of my first (releasable) projects.
